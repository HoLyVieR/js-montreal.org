# JS-MONTREAL.ORG

This repo contains the code for the js-montreal.org website.

I'm putting it out there because I figure, why not let the group mess around with it. It could definitely
use a lot of improvement. Branch away.

If you look in _public/src/signatures_, I've created the basis for an idea I've had.  Basically it's a member list, except
that members could contribute a piece of code that's essentially a 'plugin' for the page. The Javascript links that appear 
at the bottom of the index page are an example of that (see _bruno-c.js_).There's another example in the aptly named
 _example.js_.  The idea is to sort of put your signature on the page as a member by creating a piece of code that does 
something fun (or not, up to you).

The site currently runs on Sinatra, on my Dreamhost server. I wouldn't mind moving it to Heroku.  Or moving it to 
a host that's got Node JS on it or another server side JS platform, because after all this is a JS user group. I'm
open to suggestions.

More on this at the next meetup.
