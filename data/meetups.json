An elegant solution may be found in Model-Driven Engineering. In particular, Statecharts, a formalism for describing complex, reactive, timed, state-based behaviour, is highly suited to model UI behaviour. This presentation will discuss the SCXML JavaScript Code Generation Framework (scxml-js), a Statechart-to-JavaScript compiler, and how it may be used to accelerate the development of fast, robust, and richly interactive Web-based UIs",
